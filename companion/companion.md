# Companion
## /companion/

This folder contains the companion logic which executes on the mobile device. Code in this folder has access to the [Companion API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/companion-api/) and is capable of making direct requests to the internet, and communicating with the application.

If an <code>index.js</code> or <code>index.ts</code> file exist in this folder, the companion will be built.
