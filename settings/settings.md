# Settings
## /settings/

This folder contains the declaration for application settings, written using [React JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html). This can be used to make an app configurable by the user. Code within this file has access to the [Settings API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/settings-api/).
